Overview
---
In this project, I am using convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. Dataset download code has been provided in the notebook.

Dependencies
---
1. Tensorflow-gpu
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn
4. Numpy

The Notebook contains
---
1. Downloading dataset.
2. Exploring the dataset(class distribution, random image visualization).
3. Preprocessing Image.
4. A CNN Network based on LeNet-5.
5. Training and evaluation.
6. Testing with images downloaded from internet.
7. Discussion on Top 5 softmax probability.
8. Feature map visualization.
